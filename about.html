          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p> 
            The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a contagious disease known as Coronavirus disease.
            The COVID-19 virus gets mediated predominantly through droplets of saliva and mucus of an ailing person.
            Elderly people and populations which suffer from prevalent health issues akin to diabetes, heart diseases,
            and chronic respiratory illness are more likely to develop grave illnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients might develop COVID-19 pneumonia as a result of being infected by the coronavirus for which the
            diagnosis using chest X-Ray is difficult and time-consuming, but at the same time,
            a chest x-ray is the most commonly available option that can even be used in underdeveloped and remote areas
            where there is a shortage of specialists.
            Therefore, the implementation of newfangled artificial intelligence along with X-ray imaging may help in the
            precise detection of this disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project, a Residual Neural Network (ResNet-18) is used to classify image samples of chest X-Ray data
            of patients having
            COVID-19 pneumonia thereby detecting the existence of Coronavirus in the patient.

            Machine learning is the study of algorithms that systems can take advantage of to accomplish a certain task.
            The systems rely on patterns and differences in provided data to learn.
            Machine learning algorithms help to build a systematic model based on data known as training data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks come under Deep Learning, which is a subsection of ML. The working algorithms
            under Deep Learning compute the data in a way similar to the brain of a human,
            in an Artificial Neural Network, there are units called nodes, which are interconnected in tandem in a
            layer-wise fashion, in which each node performs a simple calculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            CNNs are great with computations which require computation of pixel-related data and are used for tasks
            involving detection and identification of objects.
            In case of a complex problem which has many attributes, we can add in some extra layers to the Neural
            Network which can result in enhanced performance of the Network.
          </p>
          <p>By increasing layers in the Network, the layers are able to learn the complex attributes better and more
            accurately.
            However, adding more layers means more computation power is required, but simply having more layers will not
            always result in increased results.
            If the Network gets too deep, it might result in the accuracy degraded performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where Residual Neural Networks come into the picture. ResNet helps us to solve this degradation in
            performance which occurs by adding additional layers by introducing the concept of skip connections also
            known as shortcuts
            in between layers which allow faster transfer between deep layers.

            DATA ACQUISITION
          </p>
          <p>
            A reliable source of data is required to modulate a considerable ML model. A model can only become as
            accurate as the dataset which is used in training and validating it.
            COVID-19 Radiography Dataset (by Qatar University, Doha) was finalized, which contained Chest X-Ray samples
            of 3 classes normal, viral pneumonia, and
            COVID-19 which had 10192, 1345, and 3616 samples respectively.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            DATA PRE-PROCESSING
          </p>
          <p>
            The following methods were used to pre-process the dataset:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compose - It is used to compose multiple transforms together.</li>
            <li>Resize - Used to resize the input tensor to a specified size. If the specified size is greater, resizing
              is done to incorporate the additional elements.</li>
            <li>Normalize - This normalizes an image in tensor form by using mean deviation along with standard
              deviation techniques. </li>
            <li>RandomHorizontalFlip - This is used to horizontally flip an image in a random fashion with a specified
              probability 'p'.</li>
            <li>ToTensor - This transformation converts images that are in PIL format into a tensor format. Output
              tensor will have the dimensions with the format (C*H*W), where C is the count of Channels, H is the
              height, W is the width. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">
            MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION
          </p>
          <p>
            The finalized dataset of the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset from Qatar University, Doha was imported into
            Jupyter Notebook.
            After conducting Data Pre-Processing a custom dataset was created to associate the transformed image with
            the respective classes as 'normal', 'viral', 'covid'.
            The dataset was then divided into 2 sets namely Training and Test as per 70:30 split, i.e., 70% Training
            data (10,607 images) and 30% Test data (4,546 Images).
          </p>
          <p>
            The batch size was defined and the data loader was coded combined actual labels with transformed images into
            singular train and test datasets and prepared data loader according to batch size with shuffling enabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            A function called show_images function was defined and the ResNet18 Model was imported from PyTorch Library.
            The defined show_images function plotted images in a grid with labels - Actual labels were shown on the
            x-axis in black
            font color and the predicted value label was shown on the y-axis in green font color in green if correctly
            predicted else in red font color.
          </p>
          <p>
            A function called show_preds function was defined. The show_preds function got images and labels from each
            batch stored in the previously created data-loader dataset.
            Then the image was passed as an input to the resnet-18 model (after training) and the predicted output was
            stored. Finally, the show_images function was called to show the image, actual label, and predicted label.
            To initiate the model training phase, the train function was defined and called
          </p>
          <p>
            Post the training process, the trained model was exported as a .pth file. This model was then tested with a
            sample image from outside the used dataset to ensure the model's functionality in an unbiased and accurate
            manner.
